                        of the San Francisco 49ers in the National Football League (NFL).

                        Shanahan is known for his expertise in offensive play-calling, game planning, 
                        and developing top quarterbacks like Matt Ryan and Jimmy Garoppolo. 
                        His innovative and creative offensive schemes often involve using pre-snap motion and 
                        misdirection to confuse opposing defenses.</p>

                      having joined the team in 2021 as the offensive line coach before taking on his current role. He previously worked with the team as 
                      the offensive line coach in 2008-09 and 2015 and as a consultant in 2018-19. During Foerster's tenure as offensive line coach in 2021, 
                      three members of the 49ers offensive line, including Trent Williams, Laken Tomlinson, and Alex Mack, earned Pro Bowl honors,

                    <p> Steve Wilks is a seasoned football coach with extensive experience at both the collegiate and professional levels. 
                      He recently joined the San Francisco 49ers as their defensive coordinator after serving as the interim head coach for the Carolina Panthers in 2022. 
                      Before that, he was the defensive coordinator at the University of Missouri in 2021 and had stints as the defensive coordinator for the Cleveland Browns 
                      and the head coach for the Arizona Cardinals. Wilks spent six seasons with the Panthers in his first stint with the team serving as defensive backs 
                      coach, assistant head coach, and defensive coordinator. He began his coaching career at the collegiate level and has held various coaching 
                      positions at several universities.

                    <p class="title">Special Teams Coordinator</p>
                    <p>Brian Schneider, with over 12 years of experience as a special teams coordinator in the NFL, has been appointed as the new special teams coordinator 
                      for the San Francisco 49ers, replacing Richard Hightower. Schneider's most notable achievement was working as the special teams coordinator of the Seattle Seahawks from 2010-20, 
                      during which Seattle's special teams units ranked first in the NFL in takeaways, second in blocked kicks, and fifth in touchdowns scored. Although San Francisco's special teams were lackluster in 2021, 
                      Schneider has a proven track record of reviving teams' special teams units, having produced mostly elite groups in his first few years with the Seahawks. 
                      Now he has been tasked with doing the same for the 49ers.</p>
